\caption{The general ladder network can also achieve sensitive product switching.  In this network, binding energies favor the product ($\rho_\gamma$) on one side of the ladder while activation energies favor the other product ($\rho_\delta$).  Dissipation is used to drive $\epsilon_u,$ increasing the ratio of rescues to discards $u^S/d^S,$ thereby shifting the network from low orthogonality ($\rho_\gamma$ favored) to high orthogonality ($\rho_\delta$ favored). \label{fig:ladder_switch}}
