\caption{(a) One side of the generalized ladder network \cite{Murugan2012}.  The full ladder contains a second side, symmetric about the $0$ node.  The two sides of the ladder have different $u^S, d^S$ constants ($S=\{R, W\}$ for `right' and `wrong' sides of the ladder, respectively). (b)  Orthogonality and error for the two-loop ladder.  In the energetic regime ($\delta$=0, solid curves), minimum error (blue) is achieved in the low orthogonality (green) limit.  In the kinetic regime ($\gamma$=0, dashed curves), minimum error is achieved in the high orthogonality limit.  (c) Non-monotonicity in the energetic regime.  The error rate ($\xi$, blue) is minimized (red line, $\xi=e^{-4\gamma}$ corresponding to $e^{-2\gamma}$ proofreading per loop) where dissipation (black) is maximized and orthogonality ($\Theta$, green) is minimized. Red tick indicates value of rate $d\approx15$. (d) Orthogonality is not always  an increasing function of dissipation.  Dissipation (black), error (blue), and orthogonality (green) for a two-loop ladder network in the energetic regime for which dissipation is maximized as orthogonality is minimized.  Note that the error rate is minimized (red line, $\xi=e^{-4\gamma}$) at lower dissipation than in the energetic-regime network at left (black line in (c) vs black line in (d)). \label{fig:ladder}}
