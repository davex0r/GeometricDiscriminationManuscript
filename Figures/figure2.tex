\caption{A Hopfield-Ninio style network designed to tune product selectivity by modulating dissipation (black).  One product $\rho_{\gamma}$ has a lower binding energy and is favored in the energetic regime, while the other $\rho_{\delta}$ is has a lower activation energy and is favored in the kinetic regime.  The log of the ratio between the products ($\rho_{\gamma}$/$\rho_{\delta}$, blue), can be shifted from 2 ($\rho_{\gamma}$  favored) to -2 ($\rho_{\delta}$ favored) by driving across a single reaction.  This is due to orthogonality (green line) increasing, which shifts the network from the energetic to the kinetic regime. \label{fig:hop_switch}}
