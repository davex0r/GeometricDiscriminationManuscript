\caption{Orthogonality in the Hopfield-Ninio scheme.  (a) Reaction diagram of the scheme.  Note that in the energetic regime, $k_W$ and $l_W$ will differ from $k_R$ and $l_R$ by a factor $e^{\gamma}$.  In the kinetic regime, $k_R$ and $k^{\prime}_R$ increase by a factor $e^{\delta}$ and $l_W$ and $l^{\prime}_W$ increase by a factor $e^{\delta_p}$ \cite{Rao2015}.  (b) Orthogonality bounds minimum error rate in the energetic regime  ($\gamma=1, \delta=0$). The log of the error rate $(\log(\xi))$ as a function of the orthogonality ($\Theta$) is plotted for simulated data (parameter selection in Methods).   Heatmap coloration represents relative dissipation $\Delta S_i$ \cite{Schnakenberg1976} (hotter is higher dissipation); note that at a given orthogonality level, the error rate decreases as dissipation goes up (more red).  (c) In the energetic  regime, minimum error (red line, $\xi = e^{-2\gamma}$) is achieved by simultaneously minimizing orthogonality ($\Theta$, green) and maximizing dissipation (black).  Excess dissipation drives orthogonality upwards, asymptoting with error equal to the binding energy difference ($\xi = e^{-\gamma}).$   (d) Orthogonality as a function of drive.  In the energetic regime (solid curves), error rate ($\xi$) is minimized in the limit of low orthogonality ($\Theta$). In the kinetic regime, (dashed curves), error rate is minimized in the limit of high orthogonality. \label{fig:hopfield}}
